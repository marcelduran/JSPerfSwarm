Schedule JSPerf tests and let different browsers test them until expire or reach a pre defined number of tests (or browsers or any combination). The results will be collected by Browserscope which is already embedded into JSPerf test pages. Test browsers need to point to a centralized server which will serve tests from a queue based on test schedule constraints similarly what TestSwarm does.
